\section{Fukuoka - A simple rule for quadrupedal gait generation determined by leg loading feedback: a modeling study - 2015}

\subsection*{Summary}

 "It has been posited that in well-predicted movements, CPG-generated phase durations and muscle forces closely match those required by the evolving biomechanical events, minimizing the sensory corrections required. The term ‘‘neuromechanical tuning’’ has been coined to describe this process"
