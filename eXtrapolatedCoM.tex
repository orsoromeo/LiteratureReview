\subsection*{Summary}
The phase diagram given in the paper is useful in order to show that the equilibrium point (when the CoM is exactly above the CoP) is an unstable equilibrium in the sense that a small disturbance will make the state change to another configuration.\\
The Capture Point (or XCoM) can be seen as the  
\subsection*{Key points/ takeaways}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item property 1: A sufficient condition for stability of the CoM trajectory is that the Xcom trajectory is stable (read: does not diverge too much compared to step length)
	\item property 2: At any point the tangent to the trajectory of the Xcom runs through the CoP.
\end{enumerate}
