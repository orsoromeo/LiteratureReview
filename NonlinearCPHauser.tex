\section{K. Hauser, O. Ramon - Generalization of the Capture Point to Nonlinear Center of Mass and Uneven Terrain \cite{RamonHauser2015}}
Year: 2015
\subsection*{Summary}
This paper generalizes the concept of Capture Point as we know it based on a LIP model on a flat terrain. The new model is a Nonlinear Inverted Pendulum, meaning that the height of the CoM is no more constrained to be constant but it can be a steep line or a parabola. In the mean time also uneven terrains are considered, when characterized by a polygonal shape.
