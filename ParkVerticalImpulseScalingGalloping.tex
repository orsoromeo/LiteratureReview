\section{Quadrupedal galloping control for a wide range of speed via vertical impulse scaling}

\subsection*{Summary}
The baseline gait design is made of three optimization processes made in a cascade:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Optimization of the parameters associated to the ground reaction forces (decision variables are $\alpha^{GRF}_z$, $\alpha^{GRF}_x$ and $s$ (phase shift))
\item Design of the swing phase
\item Optimization process for obtaining the periodic limit cycle depending on the current speed (decision variables are stance time and swing time)
\end{enumerate}
