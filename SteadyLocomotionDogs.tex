\section{Maes - Steady locomotion in dogs: temporal and associated spatial coordination patterns and the effect of speed - 2007}

\subsection*{Summary}
\subsection*{Take aways}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The duty factor of the front legs in dogs is usually not the same of hind legs. At low speeds the the front legs need to support the weight of the body (in dogs more than 60\% of the total mass weights on the front legs) so the duty factor ($T_{st}/T$) of front legs is higher than the one of hind legs. As an opposite, at high speeds the propellant role of hindlimbs takes over and therefore the duty factor of the hindlimbs increases and becomes larger than the one of front legs.
\end{enumerate}
